# Liney-Draw-Nonsense

When we were children there was an annoying drawing game which I probably can't mention for copyright reasons. It annoyed us, drawing anything including a simple box required the patience of a saint and the motor skills of a brain surgeon. A circle was impossible.
To celebrate this childhood horror I have created this version in LUA for the Tic80.

# Instructions

Press Z to start the experience.

Use the arrow keys to move around. If you want to change colour press ENTER. This will move you to "Palette Mode" and you can use left and right arrows to choose your colour. Then press SPACE again to return to drawing mode. If you want to clear the screen press ENTER. That's it. Save your picture by purchasing a camera and photographing the screen.
